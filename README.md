# Data Diva's Hub
I recently completed an exciting analysis project for REVBYTE Stores using Excel, Power Query, DAX, and Power BI! This challenge tested my skills in data analytics and visualization, and I am thrilled to showcase the outcomes of my work.

# Objectives:
The goal was to analyze and visualize critical business data to:
1. Evaluate sales performance across regions, business types, and products.
2. Identify factors influencing profitability, customer behavior, and return rates.
3. Explore trends in revenue growth and operational efficiency over time.

# Analysis Highlights
✔️ Sales Performance:
Total sales revenue of $81.47M, with gyms and supplement stores contributing significantly to the bottom line.
California, Washington, and Texas emerged as top-performing states in the U.S., driving revenue growth.

✔️ Profitability & Returns:
Protein products dominated revenue but had a higher return rate compared to other categories.
Gross profit stood at $81.26M, indicating operational efficiency but requiring closer monitoring of return rates.

✔️ Operational Trends:
Seasonal trends showed peak sales in mid-2012, with warehouses leading in overall revenue contribution by business type.
Shipping efficiency varied significantly across regions, with Southwest and Northwest divisions performing better.

# Recommendations
- The organization should focus on managing return rates in high-performing categories like Protein and Vitamins to maximize profitability.

- Management should expand marketing efforts in underperforming states like Florida and Tennessee while solidifying presence in top-performing ones.

- There's need to standardize operational practices across divisions to reduce delays and improve customer satisfaction.

This project was a privileged to look into data-driven decision-making and apply my technical skills to uncover actionable insights.
