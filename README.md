#Data Diva's Hub
I recently completed an exciting analysis project for REVBYTE Stores using Excel, Power Query, DAX, and Power BI! This challenge tested my skills in data analytics and visualization, and I am thrilled to showcase the outcomes of my work.

Objectives:
The goal was to analyze and visualize critical business data to:
1. Evaluate sales performance across regions, business types, and products.
2. Identify factors influencing profitability, customer behavior, and return rates.
3. Explore trends in revenue growth and operational efficiency over time.

Analysis Highlights
‚úîÔ∏è Sales Performance:
Total sales revenue of $81.47M, with gyms and supplement stores contributing significantly to the bottom line.
California, Washington, and Texas emerged as top-performing states in the U.S., driving revenue growth.

‚úîÔ∏è Profitability & Returns:
Protein products dominated revenue but had a higher return rate compared to other categories.
Gross profit stood at $81.26M, indicating operational efficiency but requiring closer monitoring of return rates.

‚úîÔ∏è Operational Trends:
Seasonal trends showed peak sales in mid-2012, with warehouses leading in overall revenue contribution by business type.
Shipping efficiency varied significantly across regions, with Southwest and Northwest divisions performing better.

Recommendations
üí° The organization should focus on managing return rates in high-performing categories like Protein and Vitamins to maximize profitability.

üí° Management should expand marketing efforts in underperforming states like Florida and Tennessee while solidifying presence in top-performing ones.

üí° There's need to standardize operational practices across divisions to reduce delays and improve customer satisfaction.

This project was a privileged to look into data-driven decision-making and apply my technical skills to uncover actionable insights.
